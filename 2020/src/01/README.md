# Day 1

## Part 1

Finding 2 numbers in a list that add up to 2020. The list isn't that big so it's proably fine to brute force it.

## Part 2

It's the same as Part 1 but needs a match on 3 items rather than 2. This is recursion heavy for day 1!

# General solution

What if we needed to match 4 items? n Items? Is there a general solution?
Is this the 0-1 knapsack problem?
