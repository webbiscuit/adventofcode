# Day 3

## Part 1

This looks complicated but can probably be solved as iterating through a list with a mod 3 index. Hopefully part 2 isn't much more complicated! Bet there's some nice visualisations of this.

## Part 2

Not too bad as the mod index method for Part 1 was good, only issue was the final strategy which checked every otehr item in the list, which is surprisingly hard in haskell! Maybe there's a better way.
