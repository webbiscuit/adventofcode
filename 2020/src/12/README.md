# Day 12

## Part 1

This could be really tricky, but a quick look through the input seems to show we're only turning left or right 90, 180 or 270 degrees so we don't need complex maths. I think we can get away with mapping to N,S,E,W and forget degrees, which should make this fairly easy.

## Part 2

Very similar to Part 1, except the rotate maths is a bit trickier.
